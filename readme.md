## Development App to Manage System Type

This app is used in development to design and create system content-types. Examples are 

* @All - the type used to define a field
* @string-dropdown - the type used to configure a drop-down field
* @string-dropdown-query (2sxc 9.10/9.12)
* @entity-query (2sxc 9.10/9.12)

## Warning
This app is very difficult to install, because it must circumvent certain automations on the EAV. So you can't just install in on any EAV / 2sxc. 

I'll write some instructions some day, but ATM just be aware of the fact that it's not easy, but that's by design.
